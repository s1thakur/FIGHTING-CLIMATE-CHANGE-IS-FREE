# FIGHTING-CLIMATE-CHANGE-IS-FREE

## GREENHOUSE EFFECT- ROOT CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING:
Earth has warmed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880 for which skeptics of manmade climate change blame natural causes like Earth’s orbit(due to tilt and orbit change), sun(due to temperature change) and volcanoes(due to CO2 release). 

To estimate contribution of various factors in temperatures change, we compare natural and manmade factors. Findings from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies shows that natural factors have negligible effect on climate change whereas manmade factors have direct relation with the trend of global warming. Greenhouse gases is the highest and only significant contributor for this huge difference. This can be backed by the fact that atmospheric CO2 levels are 40% higher than they were in 1750.

##### GASES CONTRIBUTING TO GREENHOUSE EFFECT:
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapor are the gases contributing to greenhouse effect, out of which CO2 is the most important long-lived forcing of climate change. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began making it the highest contributor in greenhouse effect.
Greenhouse gas emission is caused by various factors, electricity & heat being the largest single source (25% of 2010 global greenhouse gas emissions) caused by burning coal, natural gas and oil.

## WHAT ARE COUNTRIES DOING TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT?

More than 200 countries met in Paris in November 2015 for United nations talks to agree for a new climate deal.

Nations responsible for more than 90% of global emissions have now come up with their targets called INDCs (Indended Nationally Determined Contributions).

Moreover, countries’ investment in renewable resources have significantly increased since 2004 as shown in our visualization. China($102.9 B), United States($44.1 B), Japan($36.2 B), United Kingdom($22.2 B) and India($10.2 B) being top 5 investors.

###### WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

According to scientists, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at this rate, we will pass the threshold (i.e. 2C above pre-industrial levels) beyond which global warming becomes catastrophic and irreversible. On current emissions trajectories we are heading for a rise of about 5C. The temperature difference might sound small, but its difference between today’s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth.

**VISUALIZATION 1:**

We chose three countries to show the effect of investment in renewable resources on their GHG emission. It claims that the countries that are investing in reducing the emission of GHG are showing a change in their trend. The investment trend for these countries have shown increasing trend since 2004. On the other hand, it can be seen that the projected axis are either going down or increaisng at a lower rate, which shows decline in emissions. Also, the slope of projected pledge is less as compared to historic emission. On hovering, additional information displays about the projected pledge. If the pledge is taken into account, the emission will be less as compared to the projected current policy, encouraging countries to invest more to save the environment.

#### IS IT ENOUGH FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO INVEST?

Nations responsible for more than 90% of global emissions have now come up with their targets – known in the UN jargon as Indended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs .

## IS IT WORTH INVESTING IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES?

- International Energy Agency finds CO2 emissions flat for third straight year even as global economy grew in 2016

- Doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 would increase global GDP by up to 1.1% or USD 1.3 trillion

- Doubling the share of renewables also increases direct and indirect employment in the sector to 24.4 million by 2030

- Improvements in human well-being and welfare would go far beyond gains in GDP

This visualization shows the benefits of using Renewable energy sources. The first graph shows how the electricity cost outweighs the capital cost. Coal has low capital cost but its electricity cost is higher than Solar energy. Although the earlier cost is higher in case of renewable energy, the benefits are for lifetime. The trend shows a dip in case of renewable sources.

The next graph shows the positive effect of renewable resources on economy. The GDP is increasing  for all the countries; few are shown in this visualization. Every country is growing at a different pace and shows a higher rate by 2030. Thus, investing in renewable is a win-win situation for consumers, countries and environment.

The increase in renewable energy positively affects the employment rate. It can be seen that throughout the years the number of jobs are increasing thus benefitting common people along with the Government and the Environment.

#### ARGUMENT

CLAIM: "Fighting Climate Change is free!"

WARRANT: Increased expenditures in Renewable Energy produce huge offsetting economic gains for governments and consumers. 

RESERVATION: Increased expenditures are not focused on high payoff sectors necessary to stimulate economic growth at sufficient levels

RESERVATION: Locally produce equipment for wind and solar power collection

REBUTTAL: Climate Change does not exist, therefore there is no need to combat it and spend additional resources

#### AUDIENCE

###### Governments

**Needs**

- Pollution reduction: Since the global temperatures are increasing due to greenhouse gases we clearly need to reduce the pollution thus reduction in  greenhouse gasses.

- Economic stimulus: As a result of investments there would be number of results in terms of increased jobs and increase in GDP

- Balanced Budgets: Though the initials costs for installations are high but over the years cost per unit generation goes down drastically in terms of solar and wind energy

**Wants**

- Moral path of contributing to the global environment: If there are no further investments in the renewable sources there would be continuous increase in the emissions by non-renewable sources of energy.

Quick fixes:

**Fears**

- Initial Capital Outlays: Initial capital costs are really high because of high mechanical machines required by each renewable sources of energy. 

- Un-recouped costs of initial investments in renewable energies: Since there are high initial costs it may happen that those investments over the years may not be fruitful

###### CONSUMERS

**Needs**

- Jobs: Since there are increase in costs of coal people are tending to invest less in coal production industry for electricity. Thus, renewable sources can contribute a huge number of jobs for the people.

- Health: Renewable sources do not emit harmful gases which keep the environment clean and green.

**Wants**

- Increased disposable income: 

- Moral needs of contributing to society

**Fears**

- Initial capital outlay for renewable energy consumer goods: Have to spend huge money for installations at individual levels which can easily be turned around

- Diseases/Health concerns: 

#### Metrics (Goal, Questions, Metric approach)

1.  Goal:        Reduce rate of increase of harmful emissions

    Question(s):    Is change in CO2 emissions discharge from current period less than previous period?

    Metric:         Climate Change increasing at a decreasing rate from previous year


Key Performance Indicators:

As we have discussed above as well in our dashboards that it in-turn affects the GDP of any country in many ways.
Little or flattening out of global warming curves due to CO2 gases: Since Electricity productions accounts for one-third of global warming emissions, so if at the end of using renewable energy the CO2 levels go down can be a good metric to measure for it.
Number of Jobs Created: Since all the wind energy as well solar energy need a lot of mechanical work. Installations, Maintenance require huge amount of labor work. Increase in such jobs due to the renewable industry can lead to useful contribution to GDP of the country.
Increase in GDP: As our charts show the trend of increasing in GDP of different countries due to these renewable sources of energy, further Increase in GDP due more and more use of renewable sources of energy could indirectly help in increase of GDP.
More and more investments of developing as well as developed countries: Future trends meet the actual investments of the countries in such technology can help us achieve the environment of less pollution due to such emissions can add to the cause too.

2.  Goal:        Increase Job/Employment rate in renewable energy sector

    Question(s):    What are the total number of jobs in the current period?
    
    What were the total number of jobs in the previous period?
            
    Metric:        Increase in Employment rate of renewable energy sector jobs of at least 10%
