## FIGHTING-CLIMATE-CHANGE-IS-FREE

##GREENHOUSE EFFECT- ROOT CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING:
Earth has warmed 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880 for which skeptics of manmade climate change blame natural causes like Earth’s orbit(due to tilt and orbit change), sun(due to temperature change) and volcanoes(due to CO2 release). 
To estimate contribution of various factors in temperatures change, we compare natural and manmade factors. Findings from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies shows that natural factors have negligible effect on climate change whereas manmade factors have direct relation with the trend of global warming. Greenhouse gases is the highest contributor and almost the only reason for this huge difference. Atmospheric CO2 levels are 40% higher than they were in 1750.

GASES CONTRIBUTING TO GREENHOUSE EFFECT:
Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapor are the gases contributing to greenhouse effect, out of which CO2 is the most important long-lived forcing of climate change. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began making it the highest contributor in greenhouse effect.
Greenhouse gas emission is caused by various factors, electricity & heat being the largest single source (25% of 2010 global greenhouse gas emissions) caused by burning coal, natural gas and oil.

WHAT ARE COUNTRIES DOING TO PROTECT ENVIRONMENT?
More than 200 countries met in Paris in November 2015 for United nations talks to agree for a new climate deal. 

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?: According to scientists, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at this rate, we will pass the threshold (i.e. 2C above pre-industrial levels) beyond which global warming becomes catastrophic and irreversible. On current emissions trajectories we are heading for a rise of about 5C. The temperature difference might sound small, but its difference between today’s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth.
Moreover, countries’ investment in renewable resources have significantly increased since 2004 as shown in our visualization. China($102.9 B), United States($44.1 B), Japan($36.2 B), United Kingdom($22.2 B) and India($10.2 B) being top 5 investors.

VISUALIZATION 1:

We chose three countries to show the effect of investment in renewable resources on their GHG emission. It claims that the countries that are investing in reducing the emission of GHG are showing a change in their trend. The investments are done in 2015 and it can be seen that the projected axis are either going down or getting stable as compared to gradual increase before 2015. On hovering, additional information displays about the projected pledge. If the pledge is taken into account, the emission will be less as compared to the projected current policy. Thus, it is encouraged that the countries should invest more to save the environment and other benefits.

IS IT WORTH INVESTING IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES?
International Energy Agency finds CO2 emissions flat for third straight year even as global economy grew in 2016

> Rising Market Share: As per Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, renewable energy sources will account for over 60% of the 5,579 gigawatts of new generation capacity and 65% of the $7.7 trillion in power investment by 2030. On the other hand, share of power generation by fossil fuels fall to 46%. That’s a lot, but down from roughly from 64% today.The Bloomberg report shows that solar and wind will increase their combined share of global generation capacity to 16% from 3% by 2030.
> Impressive Renewable growth:Though  fossil fuels will continue to be a huge power source, the increase in growth of renewables would be still impressive. That growth can be an attractive chance for the investors to invest in and get paid in near time.

This visualization shows the benefits of using Renewable energy sources. The first graph shows how the electricity cost outweighs the capital cost. Coal has low capital cost but its electricity cost is higher than Solar energy. Although the earlier cost is higher in case of renewable energy, the benefits are for lifetime.The trend shows a dip in case of renewable sources.
The second graph shows that economy is too affected positively due to the use of renewable resources. The GDP is increasing  for all the countries; few are shown in this visualization. Every country is growing at a different pace and shows a higher rate by 2030. Thus, investing in renewable is a profit-profit situation for consumers as well as for the country.

ARGUMENT
Claim:    Fighting Climate Change is free
Warrant: Increased expenditures in Renewable Energy produce huge offsetting economic gains for governments and consumers
Reservation: Increased expenditures are not focused on high payoff sectors necessary to stimulate economic growth at sufficient levels
Reservation: Locally produce equipment for wind and solar power collection
Rebuttal: Climate Change does not exist, therefore there is no need to combat it and spend additional resources

Metrics (Goal, Questions, Metric approach)
1.    Goal:        Reduce rate of increase of harmful emissions
    Question(s):    Is change in CO2 emissions discharge from current period less than previous period?

    Metric:         Climate Change increasing at a decreasing rate from previous year


Key Performance Indicators:
As we have discussed above as well in our dashboards that it in-turn affects the GDP of any country in many ways.
Little or flattening out of global warming curves due to CO2 gases: Since Electricity productions accounts for one-third of global warming emissions, so if at the end of using renewable energy the CO2 levels go down can be a good metric to measure for it.
Number of Jobs Created: Since all the wind energy as well solar energy need a lot of mechanical work. Installations, Maintenance require huge amount of labor work. Increase in such jobs due to the renewable industry can lead to useful contribution to GDP of the country.
Increase in GDP: As our charts show the trend of increasing in GDP of different countries due to these renewable sources of energy, further Increase in GDP due more and more use of renewable sources of energy could indirectly help in increase of GDP.
More and more investments of developing as well as developed countries: Future trends meet the actual investments of the countries in such technology can help us achieve the environment of less pollution due to such emissions can add to the cause too.
2.     Goal:        Increase Job/Employment rate in renewable energy sector
    Question(s):    What are the total number of jobs in the current period?
            What were the total number of jobs in the previous period?
    Metric:        Increase in Employment rate of renewable energy sector jobs of at least 10%
